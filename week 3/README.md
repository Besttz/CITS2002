# CITS2002 Week 3 Lab & Workshop

This floder is the lab and workshop program of Week 3.<br>
Finished all the questions from labsheet, but I actually didn't slove  the questions with three chillis. 
The second one seems like too hard, and the first one is too complex.<br>
As I said before, that's just simple 体力活 and I'm such a lazy person, anyway I'll start writing other exercises.<br>
