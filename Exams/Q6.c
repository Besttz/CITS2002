/*
Consider the following operating system dependent system-calls: 
int unlink(char *filename);
int rmdir(char *directoryname); 
The unlink() system-call may be used to remove a file from its parent directory, 
and the rmdir() system-call may be used to remove a directory from its parent 
directory provided that directoryname itself contains no other files or directories. 
Assume that both system-calls return 0 on success, and 1 on failure. 

Using the unlink() and rmdir() system-calls, 
write a C99 function named removeDirectory() 
that removes the indicated (potentially non-empty) directory 
and all of its contents. 
Your function should have the following prototype: 
You should assume directoryname contains only files and directories. 
Your function should attempt to remove as many files and sub-directories as possible, 
returning 0 on complete success and non-zero otherwise. 
If directoryname could not be opened as a directory, your function should return -1.
