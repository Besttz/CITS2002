# CITS2002 Week 1 Lab & Workshop

This floder is the lab and workshop program of Week 1.<br>
As it only requires some basic programming skills, I finished them without any problems. Also I finished all the "chills" challenges since I'm actually learned this unit before.<br>
So the rotate file can read characters from any file and change the amount of rotation while reading a number.<br>
For the mycal.c, I wrote without checking the code of Chris, then I found that my coding styles and how I thought has a lot of difference with others, maybe that's just one of the pleasure of programming lol. Everyone may write totally different things even for a same algorithm. And I just implemented to show a single month calendar of January and August but for any years. It's very easy to finish the missing functions as the whole year calendar or the suport of other months.<br>
That's just simple 体力活 and I'm such a lazy person, anyway I'll start writing other exercises.<br>
